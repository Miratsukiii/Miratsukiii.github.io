		<h1>Hello, I'm Mira.<br><img src="img/fliss.png" alt="me" align="center"</img></h1>
		<p>I like to make things, there's no general theme or reason to these things, just whatever I felt like making at that point in time. "Esoteric thing do-er" is what I'd say.<br>
		I tend to spend a lot of my time experimenting and toying around with whatever I'm interested in, whether it be modding, art, or whatever.</p>
		<p><b>Inspirations</b><br>
		I've been inspired by a lot of things/people over the years, these include but are not limited to:<br>
		Half-Life, Mother, Toby Fox, Anthony "Mr. Yes" Domenico, "MANOS" The Hands of Fate, Sheriff Domestic, Space Funeral, Yume Nikki, OFF, Cruelty Squad, and many more.<br>
		All of which I would reccommend checking out!
		
		<p>If it matters to you, I'm <i>Genderfluid</i> and <i>Pansexual</i>, my pronouns are <i>He/She.</i><br>
		my wonderful <a href="https://kumaru.carrd.co">partner</a> has a site too, you should go pay her a visit and follow her socials!</p>
