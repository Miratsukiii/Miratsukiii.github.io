		<h1>Sheriff Domestic in Real</h1>
		<p>Sheriff Domestic in Real was my unofficial spinoff to Sheriff Domestic, it started off as a simple parody of Sheriff Domestic<br>
		and gradually evolved (mutated?) into an a dadaist art project/ARG. The latter half of the series leading up to the end acted as a testbed<br>
		for ideas and concepts I wanted to use in later projects.</p>

		<i>I made this one after a few friends and I binged the entire Eric Andre show.</i></p>
		
		<p>I think towards the end I wanted to experiment with telling a story via seemingly unrelated absurd shitposty videos<br>
		I don't think I did that bad, people seemed to generally be pretty invested by the end.<br>
		The series started March 13th of 2020, and ended exactly 3 years later in 2023.<p>
