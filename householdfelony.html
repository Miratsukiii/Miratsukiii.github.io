		<h1>Household Felony</h1>
		<p>Household Felony was one of the first and probably most major of all the projects I have worked on,<br> it initially started life as
		nothing more than just a comedic parody of Petscop, in similar nature to Sheriff Domestic, but then it rapidly evolved into a pseudo
		spiritual successor of sorts,<br> telling an unrelated story with concepts and ideas established in Petscop already.</p>

		<i>I personally believe episode 11 was the best of them all, so I like introducing people to the series with it.</i></p>
		
		<p>Despite my history of denouncing any mention of Household Felony, I've sort of come to my senses as of late, and began appreciating<br>
		what it did for me, and just that it's not nearly as bad as I thought it was, it occupies a permenant space in my head, even long after
		cancelling it.</p>

		<p>Who knows? Maybe it'll come back.</p>
