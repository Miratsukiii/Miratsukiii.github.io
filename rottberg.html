		<p>Rottberg is confusing.</p>
		<p>Rottberg's plot focuses on a young man named Richard Arvids, devastated still by the disappearance of his father nearly 20 years ago, he searches for<br>
		answers in the a very unlikely place, the video game that his father was developing for the playstation in 1998. This investigation would later lead<br>
		to the strangest and most stressful years of his life.</p>
		
		<p>Rottberg's development has been rather all-over the place. It started in 2020 as a parody of Petscop ala Sheriff Domestic, and later<br>
		got rebooted into a slightly more distinguished project.
		<br>After finishing Sheriff Domestic in Real, I returned to the drawing board and began Rottberg again, this time with a much<br>
		higher scope and production quality, bringing in the talents of my closest friends, and my partner to create something truly special.</p>
		
		<p>Unfortunately, Rottberg is nowhere near finished right now, so I am unable to show much, you are however able to view an archive of every<br>
		early iteration of it, to give you an idea of what you're getting into.</p>

		<i>I don't look very highly on a lot of the old Rottberg videos, and I assure you<br> The new version will be much higher quality.</i></p>
